# Page-protect
#### A simple chrome extension that allows you to password protect websites

Page-protect allows you to password protect websites of your choice. When on a website, you can just tap the page-protect icon, enter your password, and enable or disable protection of the site you are on.

If you enable password protection on a website, the page will go white when you try to enter it and you will be prompted for your password. If you enter the correct password you will be granted access and the page will behave like normal.
